================================
==  HOW TO RUN THIS SOFTWARE  ==
================================

At first, you need a working webserver with PHP and cURL.
The easiest way to get this is the XAMPP project (http://www.apachefriends.org/de/xampp.html). There you can download an Apache/MySQL and PHP bundle for your Windows, Mac or Linux computer.
With that bundle it is really easy to get the script running:

 * Download the bundle (I recommend the packed version and not the executable/self-install one) and unpack it.
 * Now it depends on the version you are using:
   - Windows: goto the php folder and open the file php.ini.
   - Linux: goto the etc/php folder and open the file php.ini.
   - Mac: goto the xamppfiles/etc/php folder and open the file php.ini.
 * In this file search for "curl" and uncomment this line where it appears. (e.g. extension=php_curl.dll in Windows)
 * Download my script (download link: see later), unpack it and copy the file icloud.php into the htdocs folder of your XAMPP installation.
 * Now start Apache depending on the version you are using:
   - Windows: double click on apache_start.bat or open xampp-control.exe and start Apache by clicking on the appropriate button
   - Linux: please read through the XAMPP documentation - but I think that you just need to run lampp
    - Mac: open XAMPP Controll.app and click on the appropriate button to start Apache
 * Point you browser to: http://localhost/icoud.php (if this does not work just try http://localhost/icloud/icloud.php!).
 * Fill in the form and click on Evaluate.
 * Copy the URLs you need and stop Apache again.
